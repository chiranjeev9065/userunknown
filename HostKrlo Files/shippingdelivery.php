    <p>At CK Digital Enterprises, we aim to provide our customers with a seamless and timely delivery of all hosting services and digital products. This policy outlines the expected timelines for account activations and the delivery of additional digital services.</p>

    <h2>1. Service Activation</h2>
    <h3>• Instant Activation</h3>
    <p>For most hosting plans, accounts are activated instantly upon successful payment. You will receive an email confirmation with your account details within minutes.</p>

    <h3>• Delayed Activation</h3>
    <p>In certain cases, where manual verification is required, account activation may take up to 24 hours. If there is a delay, our support team will reach out with further instructions.</p>

    <h2>2. Domain Registration</h2>
    <h3>• Domain Availability Check</h3>
    <p>Domains are registered upon confirmation of availability. If a selected domain is not available, our team will inform you and offer alternative options.</p>

    <h3>• Domain Activation</h3>
    <p>Once registered, domains typically become active within 24-48 hours. This time frame includes DNS propagation across global servers.</p>

    <h2>3. Additional Digital Products and Services</h2>
    <p>For add-ons such as SSL certificates, custom configurations, or software installations:</p>
    <h3>• SSL Certificates</h3>
    <p>SSL certificates are usually issued and activated within 1-2 hours after purchase.</p>
